### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Lucas Ezequiel 
<sub>*Junior Data Scientist*</sub>

IÂ´m a data science student focused on project development. Since the beggining of 2020 IÂ´ve developed solutions for business problems such as predicting sales values, prediction clients in churn, classifying fraudulent transactions, clustering customer segmentation, predicting customer behaviour, etc. 

In total, the projects IÂ´ve developed so far acomplish a basic range of topics for an aspiring data scientist. Those are: regression problems, classification problems, clustering problems and ETL construction.

### **Analytical Tools:**

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, MySQL, web scraping.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** Python, PySpark.

**Development:** Git, Linux. 

**Data Vizualization:** Power BI.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clustering. 

**Machine Learning Deployment:** Flask, Heroku.

# [Insiders Clustering](https://github.com/LucasBMedeiros/insiders_clustering)

## Business Problem

A UK-based online retail store has captured the sales data for different products for the period of one year (Nov 2016 to Dec 2017). The organization sells gifts primarily on the online platform. The customers who make a purchase consume directly for themselves. There are small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through the retail outlet channel. The company needs to find significant customers for the business who make high purchases of their favourite products, with the intent of rolling out a loyalty program to the high-value customers after identification of segments. Use the clustering methodology to segment customers into groups.
