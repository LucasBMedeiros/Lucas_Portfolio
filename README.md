### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Lucas Ezequiel 
<sub>*Junior Data Scientist*</sub>

IÂ´m a data science student focused on project development. Since the beggining of 2020 IÂ´ve developed solutions for business problems such as predicting sales values, prediction clients in churn, classifying fraudulent transactions, clustering customer segmentation, predicting customer behaviour, etc. 

In total, the projects IÂ´ve developed so far acomplish a basic range of topics for an aspiring data scientist. Those are: regression problems, classification problems, clustering problems and ETL construction.

### **Analytical Tools:**

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, MySQL, web scraping.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** Python, PySpark.

**Development:** Git, Linux. 

**Data Vizualization:** Power BI.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clustering. 

**Machine Learning Deployment:** Flask, Heroku.
